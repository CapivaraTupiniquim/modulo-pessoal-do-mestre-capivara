{"description":"Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\n***A Question of Enmity.*** Two of the cards in a deck of many things can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil itself.\n\nIn the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.\n\n| Playing Card |    Card    |\n|:------------:|:----------:|\n|      1       |  Vizier*   |\n|      2       |    Sun     |\n|      3       |    Moon    |\n|      4       |    Star    |\n|      5       |   Comet*   |\n|      6       | The Fates* |\n|      7       |   Throne   |\n|      8       |    Key     |\n|      9       |   Knight   |\n|      10      |    Gem*    |\n|      11      |  Talons*   |\n|      12      |  The Void  |\n|      13      |   Flames   |\n|      14      |   Skull    |\n|      15      |   Idiot*   |\n|      16      |  Donjon*   |\n|      17      |    Ruin    |\n|      18      |  Euryale   |\n|      19      |   Rogue    |\n|      20      |  Balance*  |\n|      21      |   Fool*    |\n|      22      |   Jester   |\n* Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards","img":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/decks/DMG/Deck of Many Things/00-back.webp","name":"Deck of Many Things","type":"deck","cards":[{"name":"Card","type":"base","faces":[{"name":"Vizier","img":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/decks/DMG/Deck of Many Things/01-vizier.webp","text":"At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.

{"description":"The Vistani have long been masters of fortune-telling. In the hands of a Vistani seer, a deck of tarokka cards can tell tales of the future and provide answers to many a dark and mysterious question.\n\nAlthough the workmanship and artistic quality of the cards can vary from deck to deck, the ability of the cards to call forth information about the future is far more valuable than the monetary worth of a deck.\n\nAnyone can craft a deck of tarokka cards, but only someone of Vistani blood can imbue the cards with the gift of prophecy. Once they are crafted and empowered, they must be stored in accordance with ancient tradition, or they lose their efficacy. When not in use, tarokka cards must be wrapped in silk and stored in a wooden box.\n\n## Composition\n\nA tarokka deck has fifty-four cards, each of which has its own name. Forty of them comprise the common deck, which is divided into four suits: swords, coins, stars, and glyphs.\n\nEach suit contains cards numbered one through nine, plus a tenth card that is called the master of that suit. A card can be referred to by its suit designation or by its name. For instance, the three of glyphs is also known as the healer, and the wizard card is also known as the master of stars.\n\nThe remaining fourteen cards make up the high deck, which symbolizes the natural forces of the multiverse. These cards are represented by a crown symbol and are the most powerful cards in the deck.\n\n### High Deck\n\nThe cards that compose the high deck aren't considered to be one suit, although they are often denoted with a crown icon to mark their importance. Rather, each card is an important power in its own right. If one of these cards comes out in a casting and seems to contradict the prediction of an earlier card, the Vistani always assume that this card takes precedence.\n\n### Common Deck\n\nThe four suits and their respective cards are described in more detail below.\n\n#### Swords\n\nThis suit symbolizes aggression and violence. It is the suit of warriors, be they paladins, soldiers, mercenaries, or gladiators. It also symbolizes the power of governments and leaders, whether noble or corrupt.\n\n#### Stars\n\nThis suit symbolizes the desire for personal power and control over things beyond the ken of mortals. It is the suit of arcane mages, sages, and intellectuals. It also represents the triumph of magic, science, and reason over religion, mysticism, and superstition.\n\n#### Coins\n\nThis suit symbolizes avarice and the desire for personal and material gain. It is also symbolic of gluttony, lust, and obsession. On the side of good, this suit can suggest the accumulation of wealth for the benefit of a charity or a just cause. On the side of evil, it embodies the worst aspects of greed. It speaks to the power of gold, and how that power can build or destroy nations.\n\n#### Glyphs\n\nThis suit symbolizes faith, spirituality, and inner strength. It is the suit of priests and those who devote themselves to the service of a deity, a higher power, or a heightened philosophy. On the side of good, it represents willpower and dedication. On the side of evil, the suit signifies weakness of character, self-doubt, and betrayal of one's ideals or beliefs.
